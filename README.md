The dataset that can be downloaded from this Kaggle link- https://www.kaggle.com/lakshmi25npathi/imdb-dataset-of-50k-movie-reviews

sentiment analysis, which is a type of text classification using Keras deep learning library.

Used three different types of deep neural networks: Densely connected neural network (Basic Neural Network), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short Term Memory Network (LSTM), which is a variant of Recurrent Neural Networks and Keras Embedding Layer and GloVe word embeddings to convert text to numeric form.

The results show that LSTM, which is a variant of RNN outperforms both the CNN and Basic neural network.
